# Part 1
## FOSDEM and the devroom

---

Free and Open source Software Developers' European Meeting

> FOSDEM is a free and non-commercial event organised by the community for the community.

> Devrooms are a place for teams to discuss, hack and publicly present latest directions, lightning talks, news and discussions. We believe developers can benefit a lot from these meetings.

## Open Research Tools and Technologies

> The Open Research Tools and Technologies devroom addresses FLOSS developers in a broad community concerned with research production and curation: scientists, engineers, journalists, archivists, curators, activists.

Note:

Our proposal was merged with a similar one by Paul Girard of Sciences Po (Paris Institute of Political Studies) m√©dialab and Mathieu Jacomy of Aalborg University TANT (Techno Anthropology) Lab.

Our goal was to bring together researchers and software developers to begin bridging the gap between tool makers and their users.

---

- Allow knowledge-based tool developers to publicise their efforts and become aware of other FLOSS projects.
- Facilitate the pooling of coding efforts on (often poorly funded) tools.
- Create a network where otherwise isolated developers and research engineers can share common concerns.
- Provide social recognition for people who work in fields where designing and developing tools does not produce the traditionally recognisable outcomes.

Note:

We want researchers to have open lines of communication with the developers of the open source tools their work depends on.  The benefits of this should be obvious:
- Developers who work on research tools should understand the needs of their users.
- Developers who work on general open source software that is used for research should be aware of the specific requirements and challenges that researchers face.
- Researchers should feel comfortable speaking with developers about the challenges of their field (wrt to the software).
- Open source software isn't only beneficial but **essential** for open and reproducible science.  We want researchers to care about the software they use and the people that make them.

In general, we want to make FOSDEM (and perhaps other software developer conferences) appealing to research software developers and researchers.
