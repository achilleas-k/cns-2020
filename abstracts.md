#### Developing Open-Science Research Platforms
**Zotero, PressForward, Tropy, DHARPA**

Note:

Abstract:
From Zotero to PressForward to Tropy, my research team has developed a wide range of open-science research tools over the last 13 years. I'll talk about how the availability and selection of our technology stacks has influenced humanities (and non-humanities) research methodologies, and I'll provide an update on my team's newest and most comprehensive research platform, DHARPA.

Description:
I'm flexible on the length of the talk and the format. No expected prior knowledge.

#### DSpace 7: A major leap forward for the leading institutional repository platform
**Tale of a mature, international FOSS community embracing Angular**

Note:

Abstract:
The DSpace community is anticipating the largest release ever in 2020 with DSpace 7 ( https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Release+7.0+Status ). The platform is used in thousands of research institutions around the globe and powers systems including dspace.mit.edu, dash.harvard.edu and openknowledge.worldbank.org. If you download an academic paper through Google Scholar today, the chance is large that it is served to you thanks to a DSpace institutional repository.

The talk aims to briefly introduce the scope and usage of the DSpace software. Attendees will learn how the governance of the DSpace community is structured, and what lead to the decision to drop the two legacy UIs, JSPUI and XMLUI, in favour of an endeavour to introduce Angular as the new UI layer.

The most relevant piece of the presentation for the Fosdem audience, will be an outline of the tooling and best practices applied in the community, together with a pro and con evaluation.

We are very keen on learning from other participants in the audience what they could advise, both on a technical and organisational level, going forward.
