#### Developing Open-Science Research Platforms
**Zotero, PressForward, Tropy, DHARPA**

Note:

Abstract:
From Zotero to PressForward to Tropy, my research team has developed a wide range of open-science research tools over the last 13 years. I'll talk about how the availability and selection of our technology stacks has influenced humanities (and non-humanities) research methodologies, and I'll provide an update on my team's newest and most comprehensive research platform, DHARPA.

Description:
I'm flexible on the length of the talk and the format. No expected prior knowledge.

#### DSpace 7: A major leap forward for the leading institutional repository platform
**Tale of a mature, international FOSS community embracing Angular**

Note:

Abstract:
The DSpace community is anticipating the largest release ever in 2020 with DSpace 7 ( https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Release+7.0+Status ). The platform is used in thousands of research institutions around the globe and powers systems including dspace.mit.edu, dash.harvard.edu and openknowledge.worldbank.org. If you download an academic paper through Google Scholar today, the chance is large that it is served to you thanks to a DSpace institutional repository.

The talk aims to briefly introduce the scope and usage of the DSpace software. Attendees will learn how the governance of the DSpace community is structured, and what lead to the decision to drop the two legacy UIs, JSPUI and XMLUI, in favour of an endeavour to introduce Angular as the new UI layer.

The most relevant piece of the presentation for the Fosdem audience, will be an outline of the tooling and best practices applied in the community, together with a pro and con evaluation.

We are very keen on learning from other participants in the audience what they could advise, both on a technical and organisational level, going forward.

#### The Journal of Open Source Software:  credit for invisible work

Note:

Abstract:
Researchers rarely cite software they use as part of their research. As a result, research software and the time spent developing it have become invisible scholarly contributions. This lack of visibility reduces the incentives that are necessary to produce and share high quality software that are essential for the progress of science.  The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) is an open source, open access journal primarily designed to make it easier for those individuals authoring research software to gain career credit for their work by publishing short software papers. Software papers are a recognized mechanism for authors of research software to create a citable ‘entity’ which can easily be cited in journals and as such directly impact a researcher’s career via established metrics such as the h-index. JOSS is unique in that it only accepts very short (~ 1-2 pages) papers, with short summaries and links to the software repository. In that sense, the software papers are not the focus of the review. Instead, we ask reviewers to conduct a thorough review of the associated software (which must be open source) ensuring that it is well documented, straightforward to install and functions as expected. In this talk I will describe the origin and impact that JOSS has had on research open source and also touch upon issues such as sustainability and credit.

#### Transforming scattered analyses into a documented, reproducible and shareable workflow

Note:

Abstract:
This presentation is a feedback from experience on helping a researcher transforming a series of scattered analyses into a documented, reproducible and shareable workflow.
Time allocated by researchers to program / code the analyses required to answer their scientific questions is usually low compared to other tasks. As a result, multiple small experiments are developed and outputs are gathered as best as possible to be presented in a scientific paper. However, science is not only about sharing results but also sharing methods. How can we make our results reproducible when we developed multiple, usually undocumented analyses? What do we do if the program is only applicable to our computer directory architecture? This is always possible to take time to rewrite, re-arrange and document analyses at the time we want/have to share them. Here, I will take the exemple of a ",collaboration fest", where we dissected R scripts of a researcher in ecology. We started a reproducible, documented and open-source R-package along with its website, automatically built using continuous integration: <https://cesco-lab.github.io/Vigie-Chiro_scripts/>.
However, can we think, earlier in the process, a better way to use our small programming time slots by adopting a method that will save time in our future? In this aim, I will present a documentation-first method using little time while writing analyses, but saving a lot when the time has come to share your work.


Description:
## Session type (Lecture or Lightning Talk)
Lecture

## Session length (20-40 min, 10 min for a lightning talk)
30 min

## Expected prior knowledge / intended audience
No prior knowledge expected. Example will be about building documentation for R software but any developper, using any programming language may be interested in the method adopted.

## Speaker bio
Sébastien Rochette has a PhD in marine ecology. After a few years has a researcher in ecology, he joined ThinkR (https://rtask.thinkr.fr), a company giving courses and consultancy around the R-software. Along with commercial activities, he is highly involved in the development of open-source R packages. He also shares his experience with the R-community through free tutorials, blog posts, online help and other conferences. https://statnmap.com/


## Links to code / slides / material for the talk (optional)
I wrote a blog post in French about what I am planning to present: https://thinkr.fr/transformer-plusieurs-scripts-eparpilles-en-beau-package-r/
This topic is also related to another blog post: https://rtask.thinkr.fr/when-development-starts-with-documentation/

## Links to previous talks by the speaker
Talks about R are in my Github repository: https://github.com/statnmap/prez/. The ",README", lists talks that have a live recorded video.
As a researcher, I also gave multiple talks about marine science, modelling and other topics related to my research.
